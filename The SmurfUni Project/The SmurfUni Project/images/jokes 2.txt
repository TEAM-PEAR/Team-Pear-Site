An engineer, a manager, and a programmer are riding in a car. They come to a hill and their brakes fail.
 After careening down the hill and finally coming to a stop they get out to decide what to do.
 The manager says “We need to have a meeting to form a committee to see what we should do next!”
 The engineer says, “Screw that! Give me a pocket knife and some duck tape and I’ll have us going in no time!” 
The programmer looks at them both and says, “Lets push it back to the top and see if it does it again.”

God summons the devil and jesus, and he challenges them to a programming contest. 
God gives them the spec and they begin. Jesus and the devil write their code furiously. 
As the contest reaches the end, the power suddenly goes out for a moment, both of their monitors go blank, 
and reboot when the power comes back on. God asks to see the two programs.
 The Devil says that he had a good program, but he lost it when the power was out. 
Jesus had no such problem, and won the contest, because Jesus saves

A programmer goes out with a chick. Next day he tells his friend how the date went: “
It was raining, we were soaked. We went to her place where she started to undress before me… 
Then she threw the wet clothes on the computer” – “Wow… what kind of computer?” – the other says.
